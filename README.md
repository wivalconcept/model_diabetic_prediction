Diabetes is responsible for imposing a significant health burden and accounts for
substantial health care expenditures in the world. The aim of the work was to develop a predictive
model based on diabetic food-dependent patient inpatient data that encompass admin-
istrative, demographic, and clinical features that can predict patient readmission to
hospitals within 30 days after discharge from index hospitalisation. With the proposed
Catboost Classifier model an ensemble machine learning technique, we were able to
achieve an accuracy performance of 88 percent, an improvement over other machine
learning model.
